# FFmpeg Build Script for macOS
This script was made to compile static FFmpeg with common codecs for Linux and macOS by Martin Riedl [@martinr92](https://gitlab.com/martinr92). I made the FFmpeg compiled by this script a shared one, with LTO and PGO (currently for x265, SVT-AV1, vvenc, vvdec) optimization, focusing on CLI usage and achieving the best performance possible.

## Compatibility with Linux
This script is currently not compatible with Linux, because of the difference in sed's syntax, clang/gnu, and the behavior of CMake. I will try to work on it later after finishing my main development goals.

已在Fedora 43, Ubuntu 25.04, Debian 12.10上测试能够正常使用

## Looking for the pre-compiled result?
You can check out the [latest release](https://github.com/MiKayule/ffmpeg-build-macos/releases/latest/download/ffmpeg-gpl-shared-macos-arm64.zip) for a fully optimized macOS ARM64 shared build.

You can also check out the [build server](https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de) held by the upstream author, Martin Riedl @martinr92. Here you can download builds for Linux and macOS, but without VVC codecs or optimizations.

## Requirements
There are just a few dependencies to other tools. Most of the software is compiled or downloaded during script execution. Also most of the tools should be already available on the system by default.

### Linux
- gcc (c and c++ compiler)
- curl
- make
- zip, bunzip2
- rust / cargo / cargo-c
- python3 (including pip virtualenv)

### macOS
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835)
- rust / cargo / cargo-c
- python3 (including pip virtualenv)

### Windows (not supported)
For compilation on Windows please use `MSYS2`. Follow the whole instructions for installation (including step 7).
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

## Execution
> ### Note
> The PGO training process of vvenc runs very slowly. If it is way too slow for you, you can choose a lighter PGO training process for vvenc. Please follow the comments in `script/build-vvenc.sh`.

All files that are downloaded and generated through this script are placed in the current working directory. The recommendation is to use an empty folder for this and execute the `build.sh`.
```sh
mkdir ffmpeg-compile
cd ffmpeg-compile
../build.sh
```

You can use the following parameters
- `-FFMPEG_SNAPSHOT=YES` for using the latest snapshot of FFmpeg instead of the last release
- `-SKIP_TEST=YES` for skipping the tests after compiling
- `-SKIP_BUNDLE=YES` for skipping creating the `ffmpeg-success.zip` file
- `-CPU_LIMIT=num` for limit CPU thread usage (default: automatically detected)

If you don't need a codec/library, you can also disable them:
- libraries
    - `-SKIP_LIBKLVANC=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBBLURAY=YES`
    - `-SKIP_SNAPPY=YES`
    - `-SKIP_SRT=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBVMAF=YES`
    - `-SKIP_ZIMG=YES`
    - `-SKIP_ZVBI=YES`
- video codecs
    - `-SKIP_AOM=YES`
    - `-SKIP_DAV1D=YES`
    - `-SKIP_OPEN_H264=YES`
    - `-SKIP_OPEN_JPEG=YES`
    - `-SKIP_RAV1E=YES`
    - `-SKIP_SVT_AV1=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBTHEORA=YES`
    - `-SKIP_VPX=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBWEBP=YES`
    - `-SKIP_X264=YES`
    - `-SKIP_X265=YES`
    - `-SKIP_X265_MULTIBIT=YES`
- audio codecs
    - `-SKIP_LAME=YES`
    - `-SKIP_OPUS=YES`
    - `-SKIP_LIBVORBIS=YES`

After the execution a new folder called `out` exists. It contains the compiled FFmpeg binary (in the `bin` sub-folder).
The `ffmpeg-success.zip` contains also all binary files of FFmpeg, FFprobe and FFplay.

### Decklink
It is required to prepare the Blackmagic Decklink SDK manually, because a automated download is not possible.
Download the SDK manually from the [Blackmagic Website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/developer/) and extract the compressed file.
Then add the following parameters (for the SDK include location):
```sh
-DECKLINK_SDK=/path/to/SDK/os/include -SKIP_DECKLINK=NO
```

## Validate Build
### Dynamic Linking
You can check dynamically linked libraries using the follwing command:
```
# macOS
otool -L out/bin/ffmpeg

# linux
ldd out/bin/ffmpeg
```

## Build failed?
Check the detailed logfiles in the `log` directory. Each build step has its own file starting with "build-*".

If the build of ffmpeg failes during the configuration phase (e.g. because it doesn't find one codec) check also the log file in `source/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-*/ffbuild/config.log`.
